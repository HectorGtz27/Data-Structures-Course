# Data-Structures-Course


During this project, I delved into the realm of data structures and algorithms, harnessing the power of the C++ programming language. The primary objective was to create a robust software solution that could enhance control over product flow through Canal posts, optimize route selection, and minimize delivery delays.

To achieve this, I harnessed a diverse array of data structures, including Linked Lists, Binary Search Trees (BST), Splay Trees, Heap Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables and more. Additionally, I applied intricate algorithms such as Merge Sort and Binary Search to facilitate efficient data manipulation and retrieval.

The project's core aim was to collect and process extensive data, enabling the development of strategic approaches to avoid or mitigate potential bottlenecks and delivery challenges. By employing these advanced data structures and algorithms, we laid the groundwork for more streamlined and optimized product logistics, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency and ensuring timely deliveries.
